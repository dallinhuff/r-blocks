          R-Blocks meet and exceed all IBC and IRC requirements for building materials.
          Our polyurethane ICF blocks deliver rapid payoff compared to traditional
          stick-frame or concrete walls made from ICF blocks with expanded polystyrene (EPS).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-400">
          R-Blocks' advantages over EPS rapidly accelerate during construction and after project completion.
          Our durable, long-lasting polyurethane molds deliver quantifiable benefits.

        <IconBlock title="R-value">
          The insulation value of solid, reinforced concrete walls with R-Blocks is R-80,
          nearly 6 times that of stick-framed insulated walls
          and more than double that of concrete walls made with EPS blocks.
        </IconBlock>
        <IconBlock title="Rigidity">
          Polyurethane R-Blocks' greater thickness and density make them easier to install than EPS blocks.
          Minimum bracing lets you pour walls higher, straighter, and seamlessly
          without the risks of blowouts associated with EPS molds.
        </IconBlock>
        <IconBlock title="Ruggedness">
          R-Blocks are built to last and have significantly more resistance to
          water, fire, bugs, and other environmental conditions.
          Our high-grade plastic inserts will not split or crack
          when attaching interior drywall or exterior materials.
